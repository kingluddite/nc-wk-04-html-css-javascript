  <title>Inline Event Handlers Example</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>
    In this example, we have a simple HTML button element with an onclick attribute that contains a JavaScript function
    that will be executed when the button is clicked. The function displays an alert box with the message "Hello,
    world!"
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that inline event handlers are not generally considered best practice in modern web development, as they can
    make code harder to maintain and can be difficult to debug. Instead, it is generally recommended to use the
    addEventListener() method to attach event handlers to elements in a more modular and maintainable way.

  <button onclick="alert('Hello, world!')">Click me</button>
