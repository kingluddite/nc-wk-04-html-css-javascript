  <h1>Why use a for loop vs a for of loop in JavaScript?</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>
      The main difference between a <code>for</code> loop and a <code>for...of</code> loop in JavaScript is that a
      <code>for</code> loop is used to loop through a block of code a specified number of times, while a
      <code>for...of</code> loop is used to iterate over iterable objects (such as arrays) and loop through their
      values.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you need to loop a specific number of times, then a <code>for</code> loop is the way to go. For example, if you
    need to loop through an array and perform a certain action on each element, you could use a <code>for</code> loop to
    iterate over the array using its length property:
  </p>
  <pre><code>const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}</code></pre>
  <p>
    If you only need to loop through the values of an iterable object, a <code>for...of</code> loop can make your code
    more concise and easier to read. Here's an example of how you could use a <code>for...of</code> loop to iterate over
    an array:
  </p>
  <pre><code>const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (const value of arr) {
  console.log(value);
}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Ultimately, the choice between a <code>for</code> loop and a <code>for...of</code> loop depends on what you're
    trying to accomplish in your code. Both types of loops have their own unique use cases and can be powerful tools in
    the right hands.

  <h2>What is the difference between iterables and arrays?</h2>
  <h3>This is an advanced topic</h3>
  <p>In JavaScript, an array is a special kind of object that stores an ordered list of data. It is indexed by
    non-negative integers, with the first element at index 0, the second element at index 1, and so on. Arrays have a
    length property, which is the number of elements in the array.</p>
  <p>While arrays are iterables, not all iterables are arrays. For example, strings, maps, sets, and generators are also
    iterables, but they are not arrays. Iterables offer a more general and flexible way to work with sequences of values
    in JavaScript.</p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, an iterable is a generalization of the array concept, and it represents a sequence of values that
    can be iterated over using a for...of loop. The iterable can be any object that has a Symbol.iterator property that
    returns an iterator. An iterator is an object that has a next method, which returns the next value in the sequence
    and
    a done property that indicates when the iteration is complete.
  </p>

  <p>While arrays are iterables, not all iterables are arrays. For example, strings, maps, sets, and generators are also
    iterables, but they are not arrays. Iterables offer a more general and flexible way to work with sequences of values
