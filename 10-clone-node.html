  <h1>Clone Node</h1>
  <p>In JavaScript, Node.cloneNode() is a method that creates a copy of a node in the document, while
    Node.cloneNode(true) creates a deep copy of the node and all its descendants.</p>
  <p>When Node.cloneNode() is called without any arguments, it creates a shallow copy of the node, which means that the
    cloned node is an exact copy of the original node, but without any child nodes. The cloned node will have the same
    properties and attributes as the original node, but its child nodes will be empty.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, when Node.cloneNode(true) is called, it creates a deep copy of the node, which means that the
    cloned node will include all the child nodes and their descendants. The cloned node will have the same properties,
    attributes, and child nodes as the original node.</p>
